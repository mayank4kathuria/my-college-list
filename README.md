This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to run it locally?
  1) Clone the repo on your local machine.
  2) Move over to the folder my-college-list and do a yarn add or npm i
  3) Do a yarn start or npm start
  4) Enjoy!

**Note: This is tested on desktop (Chrome v83) and Mobile (Firefox v68.5).  There could be bugs on other browsers as it isn't extensively tested**

## About the assigment

In the project I was asked to develop a webpage from a Zeplin design and implement Infinite scroll which could load 10 colleges
initially and once the user has scrolled till the next the next in line colleges should be displayed. This process should
be repeated until the user has scrolled till the end (in my case 50 colleges).

### Features
  1) Smooth Infinite scroll
  2) Mobile device friendly, Uses Mobile first approach
  3) Responsive webpage for mobile and desktop devices
  4) Optimised performance by caching asserts, reducing redundant re-renders, using stateless Function components
     for simple UI elements.
  5) All design elements are make using HTML, CSS, hence are light-weight and efficient.
  6) Flexible, modular, Nearly organised written code following industry's best practices.

### short comings

We all chase perfection in this world yet we always fall short of it. The project is a work of couple of hours and is tested by a single person and hence
has some known short comings like UI elements might differ on mobile devices apart from mentioned above, Rating stars are missing from actual implmentation
as asserts were missing in the design, inline styling of certain elements were left due to lack of solution about it's implmentation.

### what could be improved

The project could be tested on multiple devices using multiple browsers to bring out the possible bugs to develop a robust website. Apart from it, Lazy load of
components, optimisations in the API level could be performed to further improve the webpage's performance.


**Hope you have a good day**
